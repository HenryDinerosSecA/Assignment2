Beginning thoughts - compared to Assignment 1, this project will require less information to 
implement into the elements so hopefully it will go smoother than that one.

Dev thoughts 1 - gonna try to use better semantics and not leave unused code out,
 this will be easier since the scope of the project is alot smaller - google dimensions that I'll need.

 dev thoughts 2 - decided it will be single page, nav bar is function but since content amount 
 is low these shortcuts may not be as noticable, most of the page is written out.

 dev thouhgts 3 - css lol, also switching some classes to ids since i think it makes more sense?

 dev thoughts 4 - lorem ipsum to fill it out

 dev thoughts 5 - finishing touches I think
 
 final thoughts - This project I will go back to in the future to copy code from, media queries
 and screen sizes are still kind of confusing to me and I can't really check coz I can't open it on my phone
 but this project refreshed a lot of things I have not implemented in the last few labs.
 This report is a little shorter but I do not have much to say.
